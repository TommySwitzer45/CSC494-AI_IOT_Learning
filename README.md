# CSC494-AI_IOT_Learning
Through the Dirt Bike Sensor Monitor project, I want to learn how to build a practical IoT system that combines both hardware and software to solve a real-world problem. My goal is to gain hands-on experience selecting and integrating sensors for monitoring oil level, coolant level, and air-box pressure, and connecting them to a microcontroller that can collect reliable data while riding off-road. At the same time, I want to learn how to process this sensor data in software, set warning thresholds, and send alerts to a mobile device when maintenance is needed. AI tools will be used to help research sensors, troubleshoot hardware, and design the software logic needed to make the system work.
